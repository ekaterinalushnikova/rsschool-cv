### **Summary:**
My goal is personal and professional development in IT sphere, particularly in such branches as web development and software testing. Now I work as a radio journalist and at the same time I am a student of foreign languages department (my specialization is computer linguistics). I know how to write good texts (maybe it will help me in coding) and how to communicate in English. I’ve been interested in science and technology since studying at school. I’m a quick learner and a hard worker. I’m responsible, organized and goal-oriented. Entering IT sphere is my big dream, though I understand that it’s not easy at all. However, I’m eager to start learning frontend and to grow both as a professional and as a human.

### **Experience:**

### **Education:**
I am a 4th-year student of foreign languages department of Brest State University named after A.S.Pushkin. My specialization is computer linguistics. In the years of 2017-2019 I studied at Minsk State Linguistic University, the Faculty of Intercultural Communication. In 2022 I will get a Bachelor’s Degree in Linguistics. 

### **Languages:**
My level of English is B2 and after graduation I’m going to get a C1 certificate in CAE/CPE. I’ve been learning English for 10 years. While studying at MSLU I had an opportunity to practice the English language with native speakers. Moreover, I used to be a member of several speaking clubs that definitely helped to boost up my oral speech skills. Studying in BrSU I regularly have practice in English and sometimes I teach this language to schoolchildren.
